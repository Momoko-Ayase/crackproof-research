# Usage

```text
senbei <file|folder> [--out DIR] [-v|--verbose] [-q|--quiet]... [--scan-all] [--no-log] [--no-pause] [-V|--version] [-h|--help]
```

## Single file

Senbei writes the output below `<parent>/unpack/` with `.unpack` inserted before the extension. `--out DIR` changes both the output and the log directory.

```cmd
senbei app.exe
senbei app.exe --out C:\out
```

For `global-metadata.dat`, Senbei writes `global-metadata.unpack.dat` only when method tokens change. Unsupported metadata versions stay untouched and are reported as skipped.

## Android targets

Protected `.so` files are restored from their encrypted payload sections and written as `libil2cpp.unpack.so` or the corresponding input name. APK, APKS, and XAPK files are treated as containers: Senbei reads their manifests first, follows nested APKs when necessary, and extracts only `.so` and exact `global-metadata.dat` entries.

If a restored library contains embedded metadata, the unwrapped blob is written beside it as `global-metadata.unpack.dat`. Identical loose and package entries are restored once, preferring the loose file.

## Folder mode

Folder mode walks recursively, skips directories named `unpack`, and mirrors recognized outputs below `<root>/unpack/` or `--out DIR`. Windows candidates are `.exe`, `.dll`, and `global-metadata.dat`; Android candidates are `.so` and `global-metadata.dat`. A matching `.exe._` or `.dll._` payload is consumed by its stub and is excluded from the skipped count.

Managed DLL companions retain CLR metadata and related runtime tables in the original DLL. Both the DLL and its matching `._` file must be available; Senbei restores the declared CLR regions from the DLL while retaining method bodies decrypted from the companion. Missing or unreadable referenced regions are reported as errors.

The summary has the form `12 unpacked · 3 skipped · 0 errors · 1 suspect · 2 metadata`; the package count is appended when packages were opened. Each file is isolated, so one failed target doesn't stop the folder run.

## Integrity check

PE outputs are checked for valid headers, section ranges, entry-point mapping, readable import names, relocation requirements, and managed metadata signatures. Android outputs are validated during ELF restoration, including decoded container sizes, fixup bounds, and rebuilt dynamic tables.

A clean report isn't a proof of correctness, but a non-clean report is a reliable broken-output signal. Suspect PE files are still written and counted separately.

## Flags

| Flag | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--out DIR` | Write outputs and logs below `DIR`. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Print per-stage progress. |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | Hide progress and per-file lines; repeat to suppress all standard output. |
| `--no-log` | Don't write a run log. |
| `--scan-all` | Probe every selected target-name candidate, including files below the size floor. |
| `--no-pause` | Disable the Explorer-friendly Windows exit prompt. |
| `-V`, `--version` | Print the version and exit. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show usage. |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | The requested restore completed without errors. |
| `1` | A target failed, a scan probe was unreadable, or a single-file restore errored. |
| `2` | The command line was rejected. |
